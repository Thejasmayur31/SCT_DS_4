This project analyses the “Road Accidents in India (2001‑2014)” dataset to uncover temporal and regional accident patterns. After reshaping monthly data into a tidy format, we visualised:

National accident trend (2001 → 2014)

Top‑10 accident‑prone states

Seasonality heat‑map (Month × Year)

State‑level time‑series & monthly shares

Key findings show a mid‑year spike (May‑July), sustained growth in Andhra Pradesh until 2007, and three states accounting for 35 % of total accidents. Tools used: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn. Completed as part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology.
